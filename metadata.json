    "Description": "The model predicts the putative adverse drug reactions (ADR) of a molecule, using the SIDER database (MoleculeNet) that contains pairs of marketed drugs and their described ADRs. This model has been trained using the GROVER transformer (see eos7w6n or grover-embedding for a detail of the molecular featurization step with GROVER).\n\n",
